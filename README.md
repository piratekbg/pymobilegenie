** This Project aims to help hacking WiFi Networks located in Bulgaria! **
** Since so many ppl use their mobile phone number as their wireless network password! **
** There are no adequate wordlists containing numbers [only/mostly] **
** Bruteforcing 10 Million possible combinations (per one operator) will NEVER succeed!!! **

## Bulgarian Mobile Phone Operators (as of 2023):
** Vivacom **
** A1 **
** Yettel **
## The user can choose the pre-coded operator and the program will use the 
## the pre-coded mob.num. prefixes to append a long list with every possible combination! 
## Then the user will be asked if he wants to export the file (which he should if he wants to hack using them!)
## It`s a simpple program, making use of simple concepts but it outshines ppls stupidity!!!
